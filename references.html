<h2>References and Testimonials</h2>

&ldquo;I have known Karen for several years and find her to be a very caring, compassionate pet owner and person.  She is very dependable and trustworthy.  Her own pets are provided with proper veterinary care, exercise, nutrition and the love and attention with which they have flourished.  I highly recommend her.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I wouldn�t leave the care of my two dear English Springer Spaniels to just anyone.  Tootsie is a 12� years old, blind, requires constant attention, must be walked and closely monitored and needs morning and evening medications, as well.  Karen did not miss a beat.  Tootsie was one happy girl upon my return!  Connor is 8 years old, has separation anxiety, as well as fearful aggression.  Connor & Tootsie do not get along and must be kept entirely separate.  Needless to say, Karen had quite a challenge to care for our Spaniels.  For a job well done, I can only give Karen the highest recommendation.  Karen�s love for animals cannot be put into words.  I trust her not only with the care of my pets and give her complete access to my home.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Karen has been pet sitting for my dog for 8 years.  Our dog Attikus is fearful of just about everyone who enters our home except for Karen.  I�m sure it is because of the love and attention she has always given him.  It is with great pride and enthusiasm that I recommend her to anyone who would like peace of mind when leaving their home.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Karen has been caring for my dog for many years with love and compassion as if she was were her own.  I felt confident and at ease when I was away from home knowing that Karen was caring for Shari in my home with the same attention I would give her.&rdquo;
</i>
<br>Mike & Judy Maniscalki

<i>
&ldquo;Karen and Judy took such good care of Scruffy and Polar while we were away.  I was worried about leaving Scruffy who had a torn ligament and was unsure about what to do with him.  When we arrived home I was so happy to see that they were both doing great.  I knew for sure how well they had treated them when I saw how Polar knocked Karen down three times from being so excited to see her.  It is clear to see how much they care about the wellness of the pets they care for.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Kona was our first puppy and we had no clue what we were in store for.  Judy�s help truly made the first months much easier!  Kona loves when she comes to visit!&rdquo;

&ldquo;It was such a relief to go away and know he was in good hands.  Judy took such good care of Murphy when we were on vacation.&rdquo;
